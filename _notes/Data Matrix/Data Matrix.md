Here is my Data Matrix. Please let me know if you can't see it when looking on here, I will email it to you. I can see it but I am not sure how it will work from your end.

I did my frequency table on the GDP in North Carolina by county. When we look at the data it is very visible that the GDP for most counties is only the lower side with the mode being  the 1000-3999 range and the 0-999 interval coming in close behind it. But if we look at the mean it is higher than the interval of the mode which is due to the outliers that represent major urban centers like Charlotte which is in Mecklenburg county which has a GDP of around 130,000. Durham county as well which has the city of Durham with around 40,000 and also Wake county with Raleigh having about a 94,000 as well as Guilford County which has Greensboro and comes in at 35,000. I think these urban areas really skew the GDP averages which displays it as higher than it really should be as a state wide average because most counties have a GDP that is under 10,000.
