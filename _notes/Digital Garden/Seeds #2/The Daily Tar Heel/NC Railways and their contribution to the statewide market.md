NC Trains have added much to the statewide economic gain recently:

Off of reports from N.C. Dep. of Transportation and Institute for Transportation research and Development, NC by Train and Amtrak have supplied the state with 88,000 jobs with more than $20 billion in economic input to the state. The railways in this state also houses  more than 100 rail industry businesses and NC receives 45 million tons of rail freight. 
This is a good representation and understanding of  on average how rail lines have benefited the state and the economic market in NC.

Why has train growth plateaued in recent decades? Does it have to do with the advent of automobiles? How does this affect jobs or citizens within NC?
