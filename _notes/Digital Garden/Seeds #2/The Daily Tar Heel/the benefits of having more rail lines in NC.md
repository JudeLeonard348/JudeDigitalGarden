#traffic 


- Rail lines in NC have done a great job of freeing up highway space for vehicles and are also more fuel efficient that Semi trucks which help infrastructure and the environment.
- NC has been given grants as of recent to create a new highspeed rail between Raleigh and Richmond called the S-line which is the former Seaboard Air line which is an already underused existing railway. i think this is a good idea because it repurposes and recycles already created structures that can be used to the benefit of the people.
- what could this add to the  NC economy? Would this affect where people choose to work or live.
