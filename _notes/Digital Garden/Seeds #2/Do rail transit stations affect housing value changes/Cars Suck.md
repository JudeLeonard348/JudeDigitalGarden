The dependency on single/private automobile use has long cause urban and rural issues withing the country. It is a main factor within urban sprawl as well as traffic and travel issues. The introduction of smaller rail transit systems like the UNCC light rail have been put in place to mitigate some of these negative effects of private automobile usage. This allows for people to have cheaper and more central travel that takes cars off of the road. While this isn't rural its a good example of the benefit or local rail stations for communities.
