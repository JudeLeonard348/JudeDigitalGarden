The article that I am pulling this information from has done a study housing prices for houses near railway stations and houses farther from railway stations to see if there is any pattern or correlation between the two. When the findings are discussed it was proven that houses near railways have a higher property value than houses that are not close to railways. Just for reference that area that was deemed close was a 1 mile continuous buffer around the railways. It was proven that people look for land with higher accessibility. While housing value increases as we approach train stations it also shows that the change n housing value decreases which means most houses in the area are of similar value. There is a strong correlation between housing price, location, income, and railway stations that shows that railway stations are where people of higher income choose to live and that they are more densely populated in those areas.
