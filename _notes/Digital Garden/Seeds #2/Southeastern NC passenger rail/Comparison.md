If we compare the prospective eastern route to the western route based off of 2023 pricing, the western route would cost more since there is currently less rail infrastructure in western NC but also because the corridor length is about 40 miles longer. While the eastern route is cheaper in cost and maintenance I believe the western route will be more beneficial because the rural area has less access to rail routes currently and it will open up cheaper travel to many civilians.
