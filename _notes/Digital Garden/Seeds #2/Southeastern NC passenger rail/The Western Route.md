The western route is  mapped to go through Cary/apex, Sanford, southern pines, and hamlet as opposed to the eastern lines one stop through Fayetteville. While Fayetteville has a higher population there are more stops on the western line which hit areas of a lower income (besides southern pines) which can be beneficial to people that can't afford other ways of travel. It can also help to add economic growth to the area.
