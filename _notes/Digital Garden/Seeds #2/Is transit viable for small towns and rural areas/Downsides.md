While railway service is the most economically friendly of most public transit and is also cheaper for the customer. It falls short when it come to the coverage area of which for riders. Trains are on a fixed track that go back and forth through only certain locations, while things like bus routes can change and maneuver to cover a broader area and can evolve to become quicker and more efficient.
