For modern transit option like busses or railroads. They only become beneficial and cost effective when the population density is high enough that there are many people riding transit. Pretty much if there is no people then it becomes way more expensive to run these public transit option. more people equals more revenue which means it become a lot cheaper to maintain this transit in areas of higher density although they are probably most needed in the rural and low income areas which have low population density.
