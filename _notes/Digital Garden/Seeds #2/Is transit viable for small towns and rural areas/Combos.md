while rail transit does cover a decent area, when paired with biking infrastructure it widens the effective areas from a couple hundred meters to a kilometer all the way up to a 3-6 kilometers in effective radius. cycling routes a can also help to connect local communities together and instead of taking regular public transit you can cycle to the places you need to go that are local and in your area that the trains cannot take you to. The combination of these two things opens up a rural area to so much mor connectivity and travel within its community.
