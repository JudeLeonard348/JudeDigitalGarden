while trains fall short in local area transit and wait times for pick up, it makes up when looking at travel on a larger scale. while a bus can take you around the area they usually don't go above a 45 to 1 hour tame area from where the bus originates from. trains can take you  between counties, regions, and state which is helpful for long distance travel. Rural areas also have a lot of land which is a great place for rail companies to put things like maintenance facilities or railyards which can add many jobs a bolster the economy of a local town.
