55% of citizens in NC live within a 30 min drive to the nearest Amtrak passenger station and 58% of student's at NC colleges live within 30 mins of a Amtrak passenger Station. most of this is collected from the piedmont and coast since that is where the railways are while there is none in the mountains which means they have no passenger railways. I also couldn't help but notice that his path also follows the route of I-85. I am guessing the railway came first so what is the motive of putting the highway along long the same path.
