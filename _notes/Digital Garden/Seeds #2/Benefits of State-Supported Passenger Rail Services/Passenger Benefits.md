Passengers benefit greatly from railways, in the piedmont alone $7.8 million in transportation cost savings which helps people from lower income areas be able to afford transportation easier. My only gripe with this is that stations are usually in city centers and are not easily accessible for people in rural areas that have no other form of transportation. this is similar to the issues I have with busses. Now as a whole, NC saves $36 million in transportation costs by using rail travel which with this saved money we could put it back into rails and have more rails that have easier access for people farther away from the usual stations.
