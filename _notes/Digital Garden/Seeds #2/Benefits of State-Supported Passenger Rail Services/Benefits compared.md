This article has compared the rail growth in other states together and I think that given this level of evidence its valid to say this has and can still work well in NC with many other states showing millions in savings and hundreds of jobs supplied to rural communities. In many other state that in my opinion are more rural than most states. For example Montana experienced over $7.6 million in saving on automobile costs and lower accident probability. This is telling that rail systems have a constant trend of being efficient tools that are cost effective and are proven to help areas grow economically.
