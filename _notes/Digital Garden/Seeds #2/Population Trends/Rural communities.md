In the last decade, NC has grown its population by about 1.1 million people with having the 4th largest gain in population out of all other states in the past decade. Rural areas within North Carolina about 40% of the population with 85% of NC's municipalities having less that 10,000 person population. But on the flip side, all of the growth that NC has experience is mostly in the urban areas. I think this is because urban areas are experiencing more construction growth as well which will lead to a higher growth of populations.
