Although we do know that there has been an amazing growth of population in NC, it is really interesting to see how the growth is split up on the county level. Urban counties make up 38% of all population growth in NC. That doesn't seems crazy until you know that there are only 6 counties in NC that are considered urban. The next 24 percent is just small cities or areas that can be considered urban. The only counties that lost population were the rural counties.
