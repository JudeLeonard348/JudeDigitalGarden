this article talks about the contribution the Railways have brought to North Carolina and the amount of jobs it has supported and the economy it upholds. The NC railway systems has an annual state wide economic output of over $20 Billion with $990 million in supported State and local Tax Revenue. NC rail has supported 88,000 jobs with 860 businesses loading directly on to rail which supports smaller communities and allows for them to flourish and grow more than they would without this help.
