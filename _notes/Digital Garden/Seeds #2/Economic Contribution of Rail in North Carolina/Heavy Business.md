NC has a bustling freight rail system that has terminated over 45 million tons of Rail Freight and 13 millions tons of rail freight that originate from NC. On average each train carries roughly 3,667 tons of cargo. Most rail yards that supplement this are in major Populus areas in Like charlotte, Greensboro, highpoint, Durham, and Raleigh. I think this shows a clear correlation between metropolitan areas and railyards which is a major factor in economic growth.

What business rivals that of railways? I would think trucking probably but that comes with it's own issues.
