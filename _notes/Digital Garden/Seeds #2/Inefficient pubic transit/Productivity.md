Most public transit services in rural areas are split up into distinct groups called fixed route and demand response. fixed route is where rural agencies dispatch vehicles only to meet actual demand. In the study of the productivity in the 100 lowest performing bus networks it was proven that fixed route networks perform 65% worse than demand response networks. Trains unfortunately can only be dispatched in fixed route due to the nature of trains but how do we get over this fixed route productivity issue. I think this can be solved by smaller trolly or tram systems that create a larger network of rails that can then lead to a larger station that can transport farther distances. An example of this is if the light rail lead to the Amtrak station so passenger could travel to farther locations. Below shows the locations of least productive bus networks in North Carolina. As we can see there is definitely a correlation between low income areas and bad public transit.
