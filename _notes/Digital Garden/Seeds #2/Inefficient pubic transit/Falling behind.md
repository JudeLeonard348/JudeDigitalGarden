To no ones surprise there is a lack of good public transit in most rural areas within NC and asl the rest of the nation. According to a study done by the 2019 American community survey data took five year estimates  and states that more than one million households (approximately 2.5 million) in primarily rural counties do not have access to a private vehicle. Another study shows that out of 1,182 bus network in the nation, 87% of the least 200 productive bus networks are all in rural counties. Now I know this isn't data about trains, but we can infer and learn things about that transit system through this. If the bus network has the ability to get closer and more evolved pickup and drop off networks as opposed to a railways linear pick up, then why are the worst 200 all in rural areas? I would think if they are successful across the board it would be a fairly equal mix of urban and rural in the bottom 200, but it is almost exclusively rural. This tells me that their is a failure within the bus networks which could also represent a failure within our railways as well.
