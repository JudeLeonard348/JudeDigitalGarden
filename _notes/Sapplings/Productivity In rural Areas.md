From these Notes:[[Productivity]],,[[Falling behind]],[[Rural usefulness]],[[Combos]]

I believe that the productivity in rural areas is very lacking and it is a common factor that connects public transit and average income of an area. It is already proven that in low income areas fixed rout travel performs at a lower level than Demand response which looks at the demand for transit and responds according to what is needed which is more cost effective in most cases and more efficient for bus networks. While I believe rail falls short in this area do to the fact it can only be a fixed route I think that paired with the right things it can excel. Like the aforementioned bike routes, I think this can increase productivity at a relatively low cost to the transportation agencies in low income counties. This paired with smaller rail lines that hit more local communities can work wonders for rural rail systems. In one of my notes I used the example of the charlotte light trail. If there was one a light rail that hit the most urban locations in rural counties I think there would be a massive growth in rail productivity and usage. This growth in productivity will hopefully lead to more trust and with trust and higher usage mean we will se more rail lines in the future. Its a very great domino effect.
