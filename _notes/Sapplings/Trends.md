From these notes:[[Population in Relation to Railways]], [[Population Density]]

There is no doubt a correlation between transit and rural communities. Communities with fairly good public transit have experienced staggering growth compared to locations with underdeveloped transit. But there I also a massive correlation between rural communities that are not well connected with other areas, which are also are areas with lower income. These are factors that are reoccurring and can not be ignored when looking at map data about population and income. While the addition of railways is not the only factor in population growth in rural communities, it is a common factor and a major one at that. for example, a couple rural communities in Arkansas actually grew significantly after the addition of so rail lines withing their local communities. while railways do have a positive impact on communities they are really limited by their lack of ability to penetrate thoroughly into communities, as well as it's infrastructure constraints and some socio economic factors. That's where I think it fails the most in regards to NC. Rail ways are much harder to build and maintains in NC regions like the Mountains as compared to busses which in comparison are much easier to maintain and use in that area.
