from these notes: [[Local improvements]],[[Renovations]],[[The Future]],[[The Western Route]]


Improvements to the piedmont railways are in affect to better transportation as well as connectivity between stations and companies. the map in the renovations shows all improvements that are being made to local and pre existing railways which are beneficial for current commuters and upkeep of the track. But future construction is always necessary to look at in terms of improvements for the state. The western route is a great future improvement that hits smaller urban and rural areas and provides access to the main NC by Rail line. Its a great addition that adds rail to a large southern portion of NC.  The combination of existing un used lines and new CID application will really improve travel for many people. there is also the addition of the eastern line which will run through Fayetteville which is a larger urban area and also feeds and supports many surrounding municipalities in the area. there is also the addition of a new station in Asheville which i feel will be a major improvement. As of now there is no railway service in the mountain region of NC but the addition will create a great opportunity for people and goods to travel quicker and easier through this region. this should bring much more economic growth to the area. While Asheville is relatively urban, the areas around it are somewhat lacking and this should help increase growth.
