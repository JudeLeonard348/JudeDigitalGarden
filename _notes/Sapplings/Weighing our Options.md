From these notes:[[Why this is good]],[[Rural usefulness]],[[Benefits compared]],[[Grants]]

When looking at the roles of bus networks and rail networks in NC. We must consider the wants, needs, and   contexts of the regions we are talking about. Buses excel in local area transit and have unmatched ability to evolve routes and methods to create very efficient usage of public travel. On the other hand trains are un matched in their ability to give citizens access to swift long distance travel and their ability to connect regions. While trains fall short in their ability to be interconnected with a city scape like busses are, their are much more reliable and also have a much more vast range that busses. That why there has been such a new investment in rail in North Carolina. especially with the addition of the grant that Biden gave to NCDOT to begin construction on the S-line which will reach from Raleigh all the way to Richmond. Railway provide a level of interconnectivity that only regular cars can bring, but at the added benefit of cheap cost and less emissions then cars by far. Rural areas also benefit because of the land they provide for being able to build rail infrastructure like rail yards and plants.
