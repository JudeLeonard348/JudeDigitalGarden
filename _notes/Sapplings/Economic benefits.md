Fromm these notes: [[Productivity]],[[NC Railways and their contribution to the statewide market]],[[What NC railways have done for the economy.]]

Railroad provide major benefits to local and rural economies and a very significant way. The most effect they have on these economies is in the form of short line tracks like the light rail in Charlotte. Short line rail roads are usually made from pre existing rail roads tracks that have been retired or abandoned. This usage can prevent adverse economic effects like gross business volume reduction, personal income reduction, and even property value reduction which was talked about in another sapling. They also offer provide improved customer service which is usually where bigger companies fall behind just do to how big they are. There is a much more personal touch with smaller companies. Just the Prescence of rails in an area can stimulate the economy in direct ways such as rail way jobs but also indirectly like adding support to agriculture fields, lumber and logging, and manufacturing which also create employment opportunities at these companies to help support new shipping opportunities. Railways services are also great about  keeping labor costs associated with services within the local economy which can increase the spending power of local residents.
